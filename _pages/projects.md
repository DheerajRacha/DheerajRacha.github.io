### Solving Games with Reinforcement Learning [[GitHub](https://github.com/DheerajRacha/Reinforcement-Learning)]

* Implemented few deep reinforcement learning algorithms (DQN, Policy Gradient etc.) in python using TensorFlow Keras and OpenAI Gym environments.<br>

### Deep Learning based Channel Decoding [[GitHub](https://github.com/DheerajRacha/On-Deep-Learning-Based-Channel-Decoding)]

* An application of deep learninig for wireless communications.
* Provides an evidence that neural networks can be used to decode [polar codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_code_(coding_theory)), which is usually done using classical methods which suffers from high decoding complexity.

### Event Detection in Social Streams [[GitHub](https://github.com/DheerajRacha/Event-Detection)]

* Crawled data (tweets) related to natural disasters from twitter ([CrisisNLP](https://crisisnlp.qcri.org/crisismmd)) to detect the evolving and novel events.
* These events are modelled as cluters and performed an online partition based clustering to recognize them.
* Considered both the content and structure of the interactions (tweets) between different users on the platform for event detection and maintained the node (user) statistics in a space-efficient sketch based technique.

### Segmentation of Aerial Images [[GitHub](https://github.com/DheerajRacha/Image-Segmentation)]
* Studied the performance of state-of-the-art semantic segmentation model, DeepLab V3 on aerial image dataset ([Inria Dataset](https://project.inria.fr/aerialimagelabeling/)).

### Neural Netowork from Scratch [[GitHub](https://github.com/DheerajRacha/NeuralNets_Numpy)]
* Implemented forward and backward pass of feed forward neural networks from scratch using numpy.
* Alongside backpropagation algorithm, implemented different optimizers (Momentum, AgaGrad, RMSProp, Adam) and trained the neural network on MNIST dataset.

### Voice Controlled Robotic Car
* Built a robotic car from scratch which can be controlled from smartphone via bluetooth.
* Trained a neural netowrk to recognize speech commands (Left, Right, Forward, Backward, Stop) to give to the robotic car as input commands.

### Smart City
* Developed a web interface to moniter the live data sensed from street lights.
* Implemented an IoT architecture (from physical layer-sensors to application layer-web interface).

### Drone
* Built a Quadcopter.
* Assembled all the parts from scratch and succeeded in getting it to fly.
